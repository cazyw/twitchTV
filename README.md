# Twitch TV
Free Code Camp Intermediate Project - Twitch TV

## Objective and Discussion
Build an app that is functionally similar to this: https://codepen.io/FreeCodeCamp/full/Myvqmo/.

1. I can see whether Free Code Camp is currently streaming on Twitch.tv.
2. I can click the status output and be sent directly to the Free Code Camp's Twitch.tv channel.
3. If a Twitch user is currently streaming, I can see additional details about what they are streaming.

Completed - [Twitch TV](https://cazyw.github.io/twitchTV/)

The data is retrieved from Twitch via a call to https://wind-bow.gomix.me/twitch-api/ instead of twitch's API base URL due to authentication issues (API key required). 

Improvements required: the sliding text switches in the header currently fades in from outside the container.
